# QuickDraw but worse

This is a Google QuickDraw style game that is.. definitely better than the original. 

## Description

This game is a fun way to test your drawing skills! You will be given freedom to draw whatever you want. The AI will be trying to guess what you have drawn with the help of the exponentially large QuickDraw dataset.

## How to run the Python file from its directory

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Python file (`cd 'directory'`).
2. Now that you're in the directory, do the command `pip install requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. Finally, type `python main.py` in your terminal or command prompt and press Enter.

That's it! Enjoy!
