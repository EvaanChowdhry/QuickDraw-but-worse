# QuickDraw but worse

This is a Google QuickDraw style game that is meant to be worse than the original game.

## Description

This game is a fun way to test your drawing skills! You will be given a word and you have to draw it as quickly as possible. The catch? You only have 10 seconds to draw it! If you don't finish in time, you lose.

## How to run the Python file from its directory

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Python file (`cd 'directory'`).
2. Now that you're in the directory, do the command `pip install requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. Finally, type `python main.py` in your terminal or command prompt and press Enter.

That's it! Enjoy!
